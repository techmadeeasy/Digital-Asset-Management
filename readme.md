### Uploading to AMAZON s3 (or any other cloud storage)
It is recommended to upload the file in separate queue JOB. Uploading can take a time (for large files) and the request could
get timed out. It is important to stream the file to the cloud (not using `file_get_contents`) which would eat your memory. 
Also don't forget to remove the uploaded file after upload.

Example code found at [./app/Http/Controllers/UploadController.php](./app/Http/Controllers/UploadController.php#L59).
